Naruto Uzumaki the 7th Hokage to the *Hidden Leaf Village* was once an outcast and shunned by the village due to a 9 tailed fox spirit labeled **The Demon Fox** who created [mass destruction within the village](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/b/b2/Kyuubi_attack_on_Konoha.png/revision/latest?cb=20150728194030) became sealed in him.

 Due to fear of a possible reemergence of the nine tailed fox, villagers all distanced themselves from Naruto. This forced Naruto to strive in everything he has done to earn the trust and admiration of the village. After saving the villagers, other villages, and his friends from countless dangers, he has now gained the trust from those who once shunned him and is labeled a **hero** and as proof of this, he is declared the **7th hokage**.

## Childhood (Naruto part 1)
Naruto as a student was one of the [lowest of his class](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*SP-oS5bHyIkVx58GzY25Aw.png). He had no control of his chakra (energy to produce special techniques) which in the end led to him failing his last graduation assignment. He was required to do a summoning jutsu which is a perfect clone of himself, but **failed** and summoned a dummy. With everyone in his class passing, Naruto felt like an outsider and failure thus distancing himself from everyone else ![Naruto swing](https://pm1.narvii.com/7330/b410ab6f86108e86c3621ba2cc48ff430f015be1r1-739-415v2_hq.jpg) and becoming *lonely*. This failure had caused him to do steal the forbidden scroll and master a secret technique and go from failing to summoning one clone to summoning 1000 clones perfectly. ![1000 clones](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/e/e6/Multiple_Shadow_Clone_Technique.png/revision/latest?cb=20150221104302) Although everyone saw Naruto as a failure, his academy teacher *Aruka Sensei* believed in him and showed Naruto that although everyone turn his back on him, just one person believing in him meant the world and Naruto was then awarded his [ninja headband](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DoNSeAAMpMI/maxresdefault.jpg). 

## Teenage and Adult Years (Naruto Shippuden)
Naruto in his teenage years becomes more knowledgable about his past, faces many harships including losing many of his loved ones that he has grown to love over the years and becomes a **Zero to Hero**. ![Hero](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/d/d3/Hero_of_the_Hidden_Leaf.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20150222030908) In his teenage years, Naruto finally can finally control the nine tailed fox beast inside of him, as well as befriending the tailed beast. Through his power, love, hardwork, Naruto will later be known to be in a "different class" due to his mastering of the Sage Mode which manipulates nature energy (very difficult task and only few have control). After saving the village from the destruction caused by the 6 Paths of Pain (An enemy) the village celebrates Naruto as a *hero of the village* and he finally achieves the acceptance and love from the villagers who were once scared of him. Naruto also becomes a **war hero** after finishing the fight of 4th great ninja war and is later announced to become the *7th hokage* (his dream since episode 1). This part of Naruto gave the viewers a message that you can change even the loneliest of hearts when love and friendship is by your side. This taught me that I am never alone and that I always have someone to fall back and to bring me back to my feet when I have fallen.  

### Life Lessons That Were Taught In The Show
Although Naruto has failed many times throughout his life, the story in itself teaches the viewers and the characters in the show that you should never give up on your goals. Obstacles will present themselves down the line, but you must surpass your limits, work hard, and believe in yourself to reach the end goal. **"Believe it"** is *Naruto's signature catch phrase* and was used to inform those who were viewing and those who he had encountered that his goals are attainable, as long as you don't give up and believe it! ![believe it](https://c.tenor.com/uhm5SBsYu9UAAAAC/naruto-uzumaki-believe-it.gif).

### Quotes That Are Effective In The Real World
- ["So I Was Not Born With A Whole Lot Of Natural Talent... But I Work Hard And I Never Give Up. That Is My Gift. That Is MY Ninja Way!" (Rock lee)](https://www.cbr.com/naruto-quotes-franchise-timeless/). This quote is the definition of the show of Naruto. Many of the characters all have their unique factors about them, but Rock Lee was different. He was born and failed at all types of jutsu (ninjutsu and genjutsu) but there was one thing he excelled at and that was taijutsu (hand-to-hand combat). Through this perserverence and hardwork, Rock Lee is the definition of *actions speak louder than words*. Everyone doubted Rock Lee on his capabilities, but he had excelled and overcame a lot of the obstacles that came into play as well surpassed his rival.

- ["Those Who Break The Rules Are Scum... But, Those Who Abandon Their Friends Are Worse Than Scum. (Sensei Kakashi Hatake)."](https://www.cbr.com/naruto-quotes-franchise-timeless/) Once the context is understood, this quote hit really close to home. Kakashi's father was scolded and labeled a failure due failing an important mission due to saving his comrads that were badly injured. Even those who he had saved resented him and called him a failure of a ninja resulting on him taking his own life. Due to this, Kakashi is willing to sacrifice whatevers necessary to complete the mission thus almost losing his humanity. He later was told by his friend Obito Uchiha that he believed his father was a **hero** and that if he left his teammates, he would have the been the *scum of the earth*. This struck something in Kakashi and after a few short battles to save his captured teammate Rin Nohara, Obito was crushed under a boulder after pushing Kakashi aside before the boulder had the chance to crush him. The death of Obito meant a lot to Kakashi, and ever since, Kakashi now values his comrads safety over the mission. The message to the viewers in this case is if your friend is in trouble, do the best you can to help them when they need it. *Often people only focus on their own objectives and goals at the expense of others*, but by learning to understand how others may feel, this shows to be modest, be kind and understanding of others.

## Importance of Naruto in the Anime Community
Naruto is a widely known anime and to most are their first anime that they had watched. Growing up, I looked forward to watching Naruto in the afternoon after school because it gave me a chance to experience different creative art styles different from what I was watching on American television. As I grew older, the show continued and I start to understand the lines and hidden messages presented in the story. It showed that 2 people can have the same dream of changing the world, but their approaches can be vastly different. One can be peaceful, while one dreams of destroying and rebuilding. I shared many emotions with my friends and family and **created new bonds and friendships** through the sheer love and passion for this anime. This show has played a significant part in my life and maybe many others, and I am glad I could share the same lessons and stories I witness with you today!
